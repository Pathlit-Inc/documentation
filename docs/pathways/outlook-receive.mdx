## Overview
The Outlook Receive Node is a component in the Pathlit workflow builder that allows you to automate processes based on incoming emails to your Outlook inbox. This node monitors a specified Outlook email account and captures the details of received emails, enabling you to create workflows triggered by email events.

## Configuration Parameters

### Basic Settings
* **Email**: 
    
    The Outlook email address you want to monitor for incoming emails. You'll need to authenticate with your Microsoft account to set this up.

## Trigger Testing Inputs

To test the workflow in the editor, you can use the following test inputs:

* **Test Email Sender**:
    
    A mock email address to simulate the sender of an incoming email. 
    Example: test@example.com

* **Test Email Subject**:
    
    A sample subject line to use when testing the node.

* **Test Email Body**:
    
    The content of the email to use for testing purposes.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - This node doesn't require any inputs from other nodes in the workflow.

- **Outputs**:
  - **Sender**: The email address of the sender.
  - **Subject**: The subject line of the email.
  - **Body**: The content of the email.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: 
    
    If the node isn't receiving emails, ensure that you've properly authenticated with your Microsoft account and that the correct email address is specified.

- **Workflow Not Triggering**: 
    
    Remember that the workflow needs to be saved and deployed for it to be triggered by actual emails. In the editor, use the test inputs to simulate email reception.
