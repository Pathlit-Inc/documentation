## Overview
The Text to Image Node is a powerful feature in the Pathlit workflow builder that allows users to create images from textual descriptions. By simply providing a text prompt, this node utilizes advanced AI models to generate a corresponding image, which can be used in various applications such as marketing materials, presentations, or creative projects.

## Configuration Parameters

To set up the Text to Image Node, you need to configure the following parameters:

* **Model**:

    Select the AI model that will generate the image.

    Example values:

    - `DALL-E`
    - `Stable Diffusion`

* **User Prompt**:

    Enter a text description that details what you want the image to depict.

    Example value:

    - `A dynamic and fresh workspace with glass walls over a sunny day.`

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:

  This node requires an input that can be used to interpolate into the user prompt.

- **Outputs**:

  The output will be a string containing a markdown image link to the generated image.

## Use Case Examples
1. **Marketing Campaigns**:

    A marketing team can use this node to generate unique visuals for their campaigns. By inputting descriptive prompts about the product or service, they can create engaging images that capture attention.

2. **Content Creation**:

    Writers and content creators can enhance their articles or blogs by generating relevant images. For instance, a blog post about remote work can be complemented with an image generated from a prompt describing a modern home office.

3. **Educational Materials**:

    Educators can create visual aids for their lessons. By inputting prompts related to the subject matter, they can generate images that help illustrate concepts, making learning more engaging for students.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Prompt Issues**:

    If the generated image does not match your expectations, check the clarity and detail of your text prompt. More specific prompts often yield better results.

- **Model Selection**:

    Ensure that you select the appropriate model for your needs. Different models may produce varying styles and qualities of images.
