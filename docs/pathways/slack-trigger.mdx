description: 'Trigger a workflow when a /run command is sent in a Slack channel'

## Overview
The Slack Trigger Node is a component of the Pathlit workflow builder that allows users to initiate workflows directly from a Slack channel. By using a specific command, you can trigger a series of actions in your workflow, making it easier to integrate Slack interactions into your processes.

## Configuration Parameters

To set up the Slack Trigger Node, you need to configure the following parameters:

* **Test Channel Name**:

    The name of the Slack channel where the trigger will listen for commands.

    Example value: `general`

* **Test Message**:

    A sample message that will be used when the command is triggered.

    Example value: `Hello, this is a test message!`

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:

  This node does not take in any inputs from the workflow.

- **Outputs**:

  - **Channel Name**: The name of the Slack channel from which the command was sent.

  - **Message**: The message that triggered the workflow.

## Use Case Examples
1. **Automated Responses**:

    When a user sends a command in Slack, the Slack Trigger Node can initiate an automated response or action, such as sending a report or updating a task. This is useful for teams that rely on Slack for communication and want to streamline their workflow processes.

2. **Workflow Initiation**:

    Imagine a scenario where a team needs to start a project update process. By typing a specific command in a Slack channel, they can trigger the entire workflow without leaving the Slack environment, ensuring quick and efficient project management.

3. **Event Notifications**:

    You can set up the Slack Trigger Node to listen for commands that notify team members about important events or updates. For instance, when a new lead is added to a CRM, a team member can send a command in Slack to trigger notifications to the relevant team members.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Command Not Recognized**:

    If the command sent in Slack is not recognized, ensure that the command syntax is correct and that the Slack Trigger Node is properly configured to listen to the specified channel.
