## Overview
The Gmail Send Node is a component of the Pathlit workflow builder that allows users to send emails directly through their Gmail account. This node enables users to specify recipients, subject lines, and body content for the email. Additionally, there is an option to save the email as a draft instead of sending it immediately.

## Configuration Parameters

To set up the Gmail Send Node, you need to configure the following parameters:

* **Recipients**:

    A comma-separated list of valid email addresses without spaces.

    Example:
    ```
    someone@example.com, another@example.com
    ```

* **Subject**:

    The subject line of the email.

    Example:
    ```
    Hello!
    ```

* **Body**:

    The main content of the email.

    Example:
    ```
    Hello, how are you?
    ```

* **Draft**:

    A checkbox option that allows you to save the email as a draft instead of sending it.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - The Gmail Send Node can be connected to other nodes in the workflow to pass data to the email body. For example, you can connect it to an LLM node to generate the content of the email.

- **Outputs**:
  - The output will be a status message indicating whether the email was sent successfully or saved as a draft.

## Use Case Examples
1. **Marketing Campaigns**:

    You can use the Gmail Send Node to automate sending personalized emails to your clients written by LLMs as part of a marketing campaign. By configuring the recipients and body, you can ensure your messages reach the right audience without manual effort.

2. **Auto Email Reply Bot**:

    Use the Gmail receive email to trigger a workflow run that uses LLM to generate a response. The response can then be sent using the Gmail Send Node to the original sender all without human intervention. Alternatively, you can create a draft for review before sending.

3. **Automated Notifications**:

    If you want to get notification of the completion of workflows, the Gmail Send Node can be configured at the end of the workflow to send out these notifications automatically.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Invalid Email Addresses**:

    Ensure that all email addresses in the Recipients field are valid and properly formatted. An invalid address can prevent the email from being sent.
