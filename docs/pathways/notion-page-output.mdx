## Overview
The Notion Page Output Node is a feature in the Pathlit workflow builder that allows users to create a new page in Notion based on the data provided in the workflow. This node integrates with your Notion account, enabling you to generate pages dynamically with content formatted according to your specifications.

## Configuration Parameters

To set up the Notion Page Output Node, you need to configure the following parameters:

* **Parent Page Name**:

    The name of the parent Notion page under which the new page will be created.

* **Page Name**:

    The name of the new Notion page you want to create.

* **Page Content**:

    The content that will populate the Notion page. This can include text formatted in Markdown.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:

  This node requires input data which will be used to populate the content of the Notion page.

- **Outputs**:

  The output will be a single string that contains the URL of the newly created Notion page.

## Use Case Examples
1. **Project Documentation**:

    If you are managing a project and need to document progress, you can create a Notion page for each project update. By using this node, you can automatically generate pages with the latest information, ensuring that your documentation is always up to date.

2. **Meeting Notes**:

    After meetings, you may want to summarize discussions and action items. This node can be used to create a new Notion page for each meeting, allowing you to keep all your notes organized and easily accessible.

3. **Knowledge Base Creation**:

    If your organization is building a internal documentation site, you can use this node to create new pages for articles or guides. Each page can be generated based on inputs from your workflow, making it easier to expand your knowledge resources.

4. **Content Management**:

    For content creators, this node can facilitate the organization of blog posts or articles. You can create a new page in Notion for each piece of content, streamlining your content management process.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Invalid Parent Page**:

    If the specified parent page name does not exist, the node will fail to create the new page. Make sure that the parent page name is correct and exists in your Notion workspace.
