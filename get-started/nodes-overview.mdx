## Overview
Nodes are the building blocks of a workflow in Pathlit. Each node performs a specific task or operation, and they can be connected to create a sequence of actions. By combining different nodes, users can design custom workflows to automate tasks, process data, and generate insights.

Each node has its own set of configuration parameters, inputs, and outputs. The configuration parameters define how the node behaves, while the inputs and outputs determine how data flows between nodes in the workflow. Understanding the purpose and functionality of each node is essential for creating effective workflows in Pathlit.

## Types of Nodes
Nodes in Pathlit are categorized based on their functionality and purpose. Here are some common types of nodes you may encounter:

### Triggers
Trigger nodes initiate the execution of a workflow based on specific events or conditions. They can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, triggered by external events, or activated manually by users.

### Data sources
Data source nodes retrieve data from external services or platforms and make it available for processing within the workflow. Examples include nodes for importing data from Google Drive, Airtable, or performing embedding search using Knowledge Bases.

### Language models
Language model nodes leverage natural language processing (NLP) models to process text data. They can perform tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more.

### Image models
Image model nodes use machine learning models to analyze images and extract information from them. These nodes can perform tasks like object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.

### Action Model
Action Model nodes are used to perform actions like sending emails, outputting data to external services like airtabled

### Control Flow
Control Flow nodes manage the flow of execution within a workflow. They can conditionally route data, branch based on specific criteria, and invoke other deployed workflows to create complex automation sequences and looping behaviors.

### Other
In the Other category, you will find utility node such as the sticky note node, which allows you to add comments or notes to your workflow for documentation purposes.
