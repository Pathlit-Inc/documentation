title: 'Jira Issue Input Node'
description: 'Retrieve Jira issues based on a JQL filter'
---

## Overview

The Jira Issue Input Node is a powerful component in the Pathlit workflow builder that allows you to retrieve Jira issues based on specified criteria. This node uses JQL (Jira Query Language) to filter and fetch issues from your Jira instance, enabling you to create workflows that process or act on specific Jira issues.

## Configuration Parameters

### Basic Settings

* **JQL Filter**: 
    
    A JQL (Jira Query Language) statement to filter which issues will be retrieved. 
    
    Example: `Project = JRA AND issuetype = Bug AND assignee = currentUser()`

#### Sample JQL Filters
---
| Description of Filter | Filter |
|------------------------|--------|
| Issues assigned to the current user | ```assignee = currentUser()``` |
| Issues created in the last 7 days | ```created >= -7d``` |
| High priority issues in a specific project | ```project = "Project Name" AND priority in (High, Highest)``` |
| Unresolved issues due in the next 14 days | ```resolution = Unresolved AND due <= 14d``` |
| Issues updated by a specific user in the last month | ```updatedBy = "John Doe" AND updated >= -30d``` |
| Bugs in the current sprint | ```issuetype = Bug AND sprint in openSprints()``` |
| Issues with a specific label, excluding closed status | ```labels = "important" AND status != Closed``` |
| Tasks assigned to a team (using a custom field) | ```issuetype = Task AND "Team" = "Engineering"``` |
| Issues watched by the current user | ```watcher = currentUser()``` |
| Epics with unresolved issues | ```issuetype = Epic AND "Epic Link" is not EMPTY``` |
| Issues created this year, ordered by priority | ```created >= startOfYear() ORDER BY priority DESC``` |
| Unassigned issues in a specific component | ```assignee = EMPTY AND component = "Frontend"``` |

## Expected Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
    
    This node doesn't require any inputs from other nodes in the workflow.

- **Outputs**:
    
    * **issues**: An array of retrieved Jira issues matching the specified JQL filter. **This is returned as a JSON-encoded string**.

<Tip>Use the **Code** node to perform further processing on the issue output structure. Use the `json.loads` utility to decode the JSON string into a Python list.</Tip>

## Use Case Examples

1. **Issue Analysis**: 
    
    Retrieve all open bugs in a specific project and use an LLM node to analyze their descriptions for common patterns.

2. **Workload Management**: 
    
    Fetch all issues assigned to a specific user or team and create a summary report of their current workload.

3. **Sprint Planning**: 
    
    Retrieve all unresolved issues in a project and use this data to assist in sprint planning or backlog grooming.

4. **Automated Reporting**: 
    
    Regularly fetch issues matching certain criteria (e.g., high-priority bugs) and generate automated reports or dashboards.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: 
    
    Ensure that you've properly connected your Jira account in the Pathlit platform. If issues persist, try reconnecting your Jira account.

- **JQL Filter Issues**: 
    
    If you're not seeing the expected issues, double-check your JQL filter. You can test your JQL in Jira's issue search to verify it's returning the correct results.

- **No Issues Retrieved**: 
    
    If the node isn't retrieving any issues, verify that there are actually issues in your Jira instance that match the specified JQL filter.

<Note>The Jira Issue Input node is limited to 1000 issues.</Note>
