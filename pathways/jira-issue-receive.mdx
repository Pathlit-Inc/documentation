## Overview
The Jira Issue Input Node is a powerful component in the Pathlit workflow builder that allows you to automate processes based on new issues created in your Jira project. This node monitors your Jira instance for new issues that match specified criteria and captures the details of these issues, enabling you to create workflows triggered by Jira events.

## Configuration Parameters

### Basic Settings
* **Jira API Token**: 
    
    Your Jira API Token created in the Jira administration console. This is required to authenticate and access your Jira instance.

<Info>
Please visit the [Atlassian Identity Portal](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) to create your API token.

Note that you must have ***administrator privileges*** within your Jira domain to create a permissible API token.
</Info>

* **JQL Filter**: 
    
    A JQL (Jira Query Language) statement to filter which issues will trigger the workflow. 
    
    Example: `Project = JRA AND issuetype = Bug AND assignee = currentUser()`

#### Sample JQL Filters

| Description of Filter | Filter |
|------------------------|--------|
| Issues assigned to the current user | ```assignee = currentUser()``` |
| Issues created in the last 7 days | ```created >= -7d``` |
| High priority issues in a specific project | ```project = \"Project Name\" AND priority in (High, Highest)``` |
| Unresolved issues due in the next 14 days | ```resolution = Unresolved AND due <= 14d``` |
| Issues updated by a specific user in the last month | ```updatedBy = \"John Doe\" AND updated >= -30d``` |
| Bugs in the current sprint | ```issuetype = Bug AND sprint in openSprints()``` |
| Issues with a specific label, excluding closed status | ```labels = \"important\" AND status != Closed``` |
| Tasks assigned to a team (using a custom field) | ```issuetype = Task AND \"Team\" = \"Engineering\"``` |
| Issues watched by the current user | ```watcher = currentUser()``` |
| Epics with unresolved issues | ```issuetype = Epic AND \"Epic Link\" is not EMPTY``` |
| Issues blocked by unresolved issues | ```issueFunction in linkedIssuesOf(\"resolution = Unresolved\", \"is blocked by\")``` |
| Issues created this year, ordered by priority | ```created >= startOfYear() ORDER BY priority DESC``` |
| Issues with comments in the last 24 hours | ```comment ~ \"*\" AND commented >= -24h``` |
| Unassigned issues in a specific component | ```assignee = EMPTY AND component = \"Frontend\"``` |
| Issues affecting a specific version | ```affectedVersion = \"2.0\" AND status != Closed``` |


## Trigger Testing Inputs

To test the workflow in the editor, you can use the following test inputs:

* **Test Issue Key**: 
    
    A sample Jira issue key to use when testing the node. 
    Example: JRA-100

* **Test Issue Summary**: 
    
    A sample summary for the test issue.

* **Test Issue Description**: 
    
    A sample description for the test issue.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - This node doesn't require any inputs from other nodes in the workflow.

- **Outputs**:
  - **issue_key**: The unique identifier of the Jira issue (e.g., JRA-100).
  - **issue_summary**: The summary or title of the Jira issue.
  - **issue_description**: The detailed description of the Jira issue.

## Use Case Examples

1. **Bug Tracking Automation**: 
    
    Set up a workflow that automatically notifies the development team on Slack when a new high-priority bug is created in Jira.

2. **Task Assignment**: 
    
    Create a workflow that automatically assigns new tasks to team members based on the issue type or project.

3. **Reporting**: 
    
    Trigger a workflow that updates a Google Sheet or generates a report when new issues are created, helping with project tracking and analytics.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: 
    
    If the node isn't receiving issues, ensure that you've entered the correct Jira API Token and that you have the necessary permissions in your Jira instance.

- **JQL Filter Issues**: 
    
    If you're not seeing the expected issues triggering the workflow, double-check your JQL filter. You can test your JQL in Jira's issue search to verify it's returning the correct results.

- **Workflow Not Triggering**: 
    
    Remember that the workflow needs to be saved and deployed for it to be triggered by actual Jira issues. In the editor, use the test inputs to simulate issue creation.
