## Overview
The Web Search Node is a powerful component of the Pathlit workflow builder that allows users to search the internet for information based on a specified query. This node leverages advanced AI models to provide relevant search results, making it an ideal tool for gathering data, insights, or answers to specific questions directly within your workflows.

## Configuration Parameters

* **Model**:

    Select the AI model you want to use for the web search.

* **Search Query**:

    Enter the specific query you wish to search for on the web.

* **Temperature**:

    Adjust the randomness of the output. A lower value will make the output more focused and deterministic, while a higher value will introduce more variability.

* **Top P**:

    This parameter controls the diversity of the output by limiting the cumulative probability of the chosen tokens.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:

  This node can be connected to other nodes in your workflow to receive input data that can be used to template the search query.
