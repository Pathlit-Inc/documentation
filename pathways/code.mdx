## Overview
The Code node allows users to dynamically execute a Python code snippet within their workflows. The Python process will have access to all inputs and must output a single expression.

## Configuration Parameters

To set up the Code node, you need to configure the following parameter:

* **Python Code**:

    The Python code you want to execute.

    This code will be executed in an isolated Jupyter Kernel environment as a single notebook cell.

## Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:

  Any inputs to the Code node will be passed into the Python environment as the dictionary `inputs`, with the input node display IDs mapped to their respective outputs.

  Example:

  ```python3
  a = inputs["text-var-0 output"]
  ```

- **Outputs**:

  The output will be evaluated as the last expression within the block.

  Example:

  ```python3
  a = inputs["text-var-0 output"]

  # The following string will be the output of the node
  f'Output: {a}'
  ```

## Error Handling

Any exceptions thrown within the Python process will be thrown as a workflow error.

Consequently, you may also raise your own exceptions:
```python3
a = inputs["text-var-0 output"]

try:
  a = int(a)
except:
  raise Exception("Input is not a valid integer")

a * 2
```
