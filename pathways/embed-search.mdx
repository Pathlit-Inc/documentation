### Fields in Embedding Search

- **Top-N Chunks:** Pick the number of top relevant chunks between 0 and 100

<Tip>

"Top N" refers to the highest or best N items from a list, where N can be any number you choose. For example, if you have a list of movies and you want to see the top 3, you would pick the three movies that are the best or most popular. So, "Top N" simply means selecting the best or most significant items out of a larger group.


</Tip>
In the context of embedding search, "Top N" refers to selecting the top N results that are most similar to a query based on their [embeddings](/get-started/new-to-gen-ai#embeddings). Embeddings are numerical representations of items (like texts, images, or products) that capture their characteristics in a way that can be processed by computers.
